ITAI-2373: Final — NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0
Project Title

NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0 — Embeddings & Semantic Intelligence

Problem Statement

To extend the original NewsBot with advanced semantic understanding using embeddings (GloVe and BERT) and similarity analysis.

Approach & Methodology

Extracted document embeddings using GloVe and BERT.

Computed similarity matrices and analyzed inter-category relationships.

Built visualizations: histograms, boxplots, similarity heatmaps.

Evaluated embedding performance statistically.

Results & Evaluation

Showed that BERT separates categories more effectively than GloVe.

Identified semantic clusters using similarity statistics.

Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with modern embedding models.

Understanding of semantic similarity metrics and clustering behavior.

Dependencies

NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Transformers.

How to Run

Run .ipynb in Google Colab; install dependencies via pip.
