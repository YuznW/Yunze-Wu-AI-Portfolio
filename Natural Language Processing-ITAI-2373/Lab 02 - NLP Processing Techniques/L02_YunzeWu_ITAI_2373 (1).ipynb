        "**1. Most affected text type:** The product review text was most affected by preprocessing, with a token reduction of 61.7%. This likely happened because product reviews contain many stop words, repetitive descriptive words, and auxiliary words that are removed during lemmatization and stop word removal. In addition, adjectives and adverbs are frequently used to express opinions, so removing stop words reduces a significant portion of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Least affected text type:** The simple text was least affected, with a 50.0% reduction. This indicates that the text is short, concise, and contains fewer stop words or auxiliary words, so preprocessing has less impact on its overall token count.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. For customer review analysis:** For analyzing customer reviews, I would choose standard preprocessing that includes basic cleaning, stop word removal, and lemmatization. This approach preserves the main content words that express opinions and product features while reducing noise from common function words, making it suitable for sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, or summarization.\n",

        "\n",
        "**4. Main trade-offs to consider:**\n",
        "\n",
        "---The main trade-offs when choosing preprocessing techniques include balancing information retention versus noise reduction, speed versus accuracy, and readability versus compact representation. Aggressive cleaning and stemming may improve model efficiency but can lose semantic nuance, while minimal cleaning preserves meaning but may include unnecessary noise. The choice depends on the specific NLP task and the importance of context, sentiment, or precise semantics."
