ITAI-2376: Midterm — Creating Images with Diffusion Models
Project Title

Generating Images with Diffusion Models

Problem Statement

This project explores forward diffusion, denoising, and U-Net architecture through hands-on implementation to better understand how modern generative models produce images.

Approach & Methodology

Implemented forward diffusion by adding Gaussian noise over time.

Implemented denoising U-Net components with skip connections.

Visualized every stage of the diffusion and denoising process.

Generated sample images and evaluated output quality.

Results & Evaluation

Demonstrated correct reconstruction through step-wise denoising.

Identified at which noise level images remain partially recognizable.

Compared U-Net performance with simpler architectures.

Learning Outcomes

Solid understanding of diffusion theory and sampling.

Ability to analyze the role of skip connections and U-Net depth.

Practical exposure to generative modeling workflows.

Requirements / Dependencies

PyTorch

NumPy

Matplotlib
