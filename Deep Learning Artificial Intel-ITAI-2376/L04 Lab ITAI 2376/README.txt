Project Title

Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Digit Classification

Problem Statement

To design, train, and evaluate a CNN capable of recognizing handwritten digits from grayscale 28×28 images.

Approach & Methodology

Normalized pixel values and reshaped images into 4D tensors.

Built a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers.

Trained the model using categorical cross-entropy and Adam optimizer.

Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss on test set.

Results & Evaluation

Achieved high classification accuracy (insert your achieved accuracy).

Visualized training curves and analyzed overfitting behavior.

Observed effects of kernel size, filters, pooling, and dropout.

Learning Outcomes

Stronger understanding of CNN structures and hyperparameters.

Experience with Keras model building and debugging.

Practical insight into training stability and generalization.

Dependencies

TensorFlow / Keras

How to Run

Run sequentially in Google Colab; MNIST loads automatically.
