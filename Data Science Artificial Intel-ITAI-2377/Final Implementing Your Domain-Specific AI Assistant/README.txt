ITAI-2377: Final — Implementing Your Domain-Specific AI Assistant
Project Title

Implemented Domain-Specific AI Assistant

Problem Statement

The goal is to build a functional AI assistant customized to a specific domain, integrating natural language understanding, reasoning, and retrieval to support users effectively.

Approach & Methodology

Implemented the assistant using an LLM-powered architecture.

Added retrieval components (vector database or structured memory) as needed.

Integrated preprocessing, prompt design, and system instructions.

Conducted multiple evaluation rounds with real or simulated user queries.

Improved output quality through iterative refinement.

Results & Evaluation

Delivered a functioning prototype capable of answering domain-specific questions.

Measured assistant performance based on accuracy, consistency, and user experience.

Documented failure cases and improvement strategies.

Learning Outcomes

Gained experience building a full AI pipeline from plan to implementation.

Improved skills in prompt engineering, retrieval systems, and evaluation.

Learned how to balance model capability with domain limitations.

Requirements / Dependencies

Python 3.8+

OpenAI API or equivalent LLM interface

Optional: FAISS / ChromaDB for retrieval

How to Run

Provide your .ipynb or .py execution instructions:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python assistant.py


Adjust according to your implementation.
