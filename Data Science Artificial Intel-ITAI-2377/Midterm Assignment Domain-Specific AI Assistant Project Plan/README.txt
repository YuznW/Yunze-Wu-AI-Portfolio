ITAI-2377: Midterm — Domain-Specific AI Assistant Project Plan
Project Title

Domain-Specific AI Assistant: Project Plan

Problem Statement

This project defines the design blueprint for a domain-specific AI assistant. Before implementation, the goal is to analyze the problem domain, identify user needs, select an appropriate AI technique, and develop a structured plan that guides the final deployment of the assistant.

Approach & Methodology

Conducted requirement analysis to understand user goals, context, and constraints.

Performed domain research to determine available datasets and knowledge boundaries.

Selected a retrieval-augmented, rule-based, or LLM-powered pipeline (based on project context).

Designed system architecture, data flow, prompt structures, and evaluation criteria.

Outlined ethical considerations including safety, fairness, and transparency.

Results & Evaluation

Produced a complete project plan including diagrams, workflow definitions, and model selection reasoning.

Identified potential risks and mitigation strategies.

Established measurable KPIs for the final assistant (accuracy, helpfulness, consistency).

Learning Outcomes

Learned how to translate user needs into system requirements.

Learned to structure an AI project from concept to implementation.

Practiced evaluating different AI approaches for feasibility and limitations.

Requirements / Dependencies

No code execution required. Standard documentation tools only.

How to Use / Run

This project is a design document; no executable components.
